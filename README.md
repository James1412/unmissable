## Description

Quick Notes App. Write your notes, they will show up as notifications!
Add a new home screen widget on your phone to check your notes.

I wanted to have a simple note app that actually reminds me stuff.
In this app, notifications are shown in the notification center, making it easy for users to stay updated as they check it regularly throughout the day

## Development Setup

Clone this repository and run the following commands:

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
